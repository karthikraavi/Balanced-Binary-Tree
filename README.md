The Objective of this code is to form a balanced binary tree from a sorted array.
We recursively divide the array and form a balanced binary tree.
This would take a time complexity of O(n)

Note that the formation of sorted array could be done in O(n) time, if an unbalanced binary tree is given.Hence the total time complexity is reduced to O(n)
Whereas it would take O(nlogn) to create a sorted array from an unsorted array list.Hence the total time complexity in this case would reduce to O(nlogn)
